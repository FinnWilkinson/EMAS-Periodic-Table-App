# Periodic Table App
This project's aim is to create a mobile app tool that displays key information for electron microanalysis. The base of this app is the [periodic table designed by M Matthews](https://www.microbeamanalysis.eu/EMAS_files/periodic%20table/EMAS-periodic-table.pdf).

## The aim of this project is to:

1. Create an app that shows the basic periodic table on a mobile phone

1. Gives detailed information when an element from the periodic table is selected

1. Have a search function that allows a user to search for an element

1. Create an auto-complete function for the search function

1. An option to change the units of x-ray lines from keV to units specific to a list of spectrometer units (dependant on the user's instrument)
