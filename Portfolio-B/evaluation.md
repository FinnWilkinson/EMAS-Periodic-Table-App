# **Evaluation**
// Intro para (we have accommplished all requirements that client wanted, etc)

### Testing
// we created a questionnaire and did user testing on clients as well as the common human
<br>
// put picture of questionnaire


### Results
// what were the main errors/bugs/problems
// categorize them? hueristic eval?

### Final Iteration
// changes made after getting feedback

### Future Developments/Ideas
From the initial client brief regarding the system, they outlined for us five stages, with each stage increasing the features of the application. Due to time constraints we were not able to complete all the stages set out to us by the client and so these further stages, mainly stages 4 and 5, would be areas to look into developing the application in the future.

Firstly comes an Instrument Configuration Tool as outlined in stage 4. This tool would allow a user to have a list of all spectrometer-crystal combinations that they could use to detect each element. This would enable the user to receive guidance on how they should analyse an element. This would aid our client's in the work that they carry out as they would not have to look up these configurations in a book, nor remember these configurations.

Secondly comes a X=ray line look-up/interference tool. Currently in our application is a graph of the major X-ray lines for the elements, however there are also a range of minor lines. The client has outlined that interference from these minor lines is a major issue in the work that they carry out, so a graph depicting possible interfering element lines (based on the spectrometer and crystal used) would reduce the errors that they encountered in their work.

Finally, whilst we have implemented a section of the application to view different graphs that the client wanted within included, in their initial specification they requested that these graphs be interactive. This would allow them to view the precise values and ranges displayed on the graphs more accurately.

Additionally, we have also received possible future developments from the user feedback and testing of our application:
* As EMAS is a European society, a select language feature would increase the accessibility of the application, whilst proving more convenient to the colleagues of our clients.
* A zooming feature was also highlighted to be a possible future improvement. The size of the periodic table displayed, along with the data displayed about the elements is dependant on the screen size that the user's phone or tablet has. Therefore, a zooming feature would enable users with smaller screen sizes to use the application more easily. Additionally, this feature would improve the application's accessibility as users with impaired vision would find a feature such as this useful.
